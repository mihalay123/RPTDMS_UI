# Diploma project

The project was developed in May 2021. It is my diploma project in SPBGUT.
It is the example of my React/Redux development experience.

## About

The project was developed by two students. With the support of the supervisor.\ 

My part of work is frontend implemented using React/Redux technologies.\

It was my first serious experience with React. So the quality leaves much to be desired.\

## Good sides

I tried to split different parts of the project into different folders.\

I wrote functional React components with React hooks. That doesn't mean I can't use Object oriented programming.\
